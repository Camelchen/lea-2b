CHAPTER 8

Lab Activity

1.     Use the N2 Corporation database tables to design the following subqueries.     (Use the spooling method to capture all queries and results in the CHAP8SP1.LST file.)

        (a)            Display employee Jinku Shaw’s department name.

        (b)            Find name of the supervisor for employee number 433.

        (c)            Who has same qualification as Stanley Garner?

        (d)            Which department has more employees than department 20?

        (e)            Which employees are working in the company longer than Larry Houston?

        (f)             Find all employees in the sales department by using a nested query.

        (g)            Create a new table, EMP30, and populate it with employees in department 30, using an existing table and a subquery.  Use EmployeeId, Lname, Fname, HireDate and Salary columns.

        (h)            Add more rows to EMP30 table with employee in department 40.  Do not transfer employee’s salary.

        (i)             Update salary of newly transferred employee from EMPLOYEE table to EMP30 table with MERGE statement, and INSERT employees who are not in EMP30 table.

(j)            Find employees with minimum salary in their own department with the use of correlated subquery.

(k)           Use multiple level subquery to display dependent information for employees, who belong to FINANCE department.

(l)            Use set operator and subquery to find employees, who do not have any dependents.

(m)          Write a subquery that finds average salary by each department.  Check to find if employee 543’s salary satisfies =ANY, <ANY, >ANY, <ALL, or >ALL condition against those departmental average salaries.

       2.     Use the Indo–US College database tables to design the following subqueries. (Use the spooling method to capture all queries and results in the CHAP8SP2.LST file)

        (a)            Display student Jose Diaz’s faculty advisor’s name and phone number.

        (b)            Find rooms with bottom-2 capacities.  Do not include office rooms.

        (c)            Find Spring 2003 course sections with the top three maximum count numbers.

        (d)            Find all information regarding classrooms (RoomType = ‘C’).

        (e)            Create a new table, SP03SECT, for Spring 2003 semester course sections using a subquery.  Include CourseId, Section, FacultyId and RoomId columns only.

        (f)             Delete rows from SP03SECT table for faculty Mobley.

        (g)            Find faculty members who do not teach any course in Spring 2003 semester. Use correlated subquery with NOT EXISTS operator on SP03SECT table.
