THIS IS SONG-1
Write this poem from the album Taking Chances (Celine Dion):
Never knowing if there's solid ground below
Or a hand to hold, or hell to pay
What do you say,What do you say,
I just want to start again
And maybe you could show me how to try
And maybe you could take me in
Somewhere underneath your skin?
What do you say to taking chances

THIS IS SONG-2
From a song (A world to believe in):
I know that dreams we hold on to,
can just fade away
And I know that words can be wasted, 
with so much to say
And I when I feel helpless,
there's always a hope that shines through
